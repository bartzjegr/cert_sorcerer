Cert Sorcerer (CS) Quick-Start Guide
------------------------------------

First you need to install the dependencies (on RHEL do):
yum install openssl python PyOpenSSL python-pycurl

You should then fetch CS.py and edit the constants at the top for your site.

It should be noted that CS generates key files in PKCS#1 format regardless of
the host openssl version (by doing a conversion step after any key generate).
This should be suitable for most grid middleware. If PKCS#8 is absolutely
required the "openssl pkcs8" command can be used to convert the key back.


Getting a New Cert
------------------

To request a new cert just run CS.py followed by the CN, for example to get a user cert:

./CS.py "john smith"

or for a host cert:

./CS.py "myhost.some.domain.com"

Getting new host certificates requires a valid user cert & key in
~/.globus/user{cert,key}.pem .


Very Quick Host Cert Renewal
----------------------------

If you want to just renew a hostcert, the easiest thing to do is run this on
the actual machine as root (or whoever owns /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem):

./CS.py --sys

Once you get an e-mail from the CA saying the cert has been issued, run the
"./CS.py --sys" command again to fetch it. You can use "./CS.py --sys --fetch"
to avoid being prompted for this operation.

Host certificate renewals don't require a valid user key.


Importing A Certificate
-----------------------

If you want to renew a certificate that's already been issued you need to place
it into the ~/.cs directory under a directory named after the CN. Any spaces in
the CN should be replaced with underscores.

mkdir -p ~/.cs/john_smith
chmod 700 ~/.cs/john_smith

# Copy the old certificate & key into the directory
cp my_user_cert.pem ~/.cs/john_smith/cert.pem
cp my_user_key.pem ~/.cs/john_smith/key.pem

This also works for hostcerts:
mkdir -p ~/.cs/myhost.some.domain.com
chmod 700 ~/.cs/myhost.some.domain.com
cp hostcert.pem ~/.cs/myhost.some.domain.com/cert.pem
cp hostkey.pem ~/.cs/myhost.some.domain.com/key.pem

If you certificate is in .p12 format, replace the cp steps in the above with:
openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -nodes -in mycert.p12 -out ~/.cs/john_smith/key.pem
openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -in mycert.p12 -out ~/.cs/john_smith/cert.pem

CS will fix the permissions automatically however you can optionally do this by
hand just to ensure things are secure:
chmod 644 ~/.cs/john_smith/cert.pem
chmod 600 ~/.cs/john_smith/key.pem


Renewing A Certificate
----------------------

If the certificate was issued with CS then you just need to invoke it with the
same parameters you did originally, i.e.

./CS.py "john smith"

If the certificate wasn't originally requested with CS, follow the importing a
certificate step and then invoke it with the CN as contained in the cert.

Run the command again once you have received e-mail confirmation of the renewal.
